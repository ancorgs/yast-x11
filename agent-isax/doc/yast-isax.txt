Generating isax-configuration-file with the YaST2      (Stefan Schubert)
===================================================

inst_create_rc_sax.ycp
------------------------
This YCP script reads all hardware settings and calls the agent
"Xf86ConfigAgent" which writes these settings into a file and calls
the isax program.

Following steps are passed through: 

- Reading language from the argument "user_settings".
- Reading mouse settings from .pobe.byclass.mouse path.
- Reading keyboard settings from the keyboard.ycp script.
- Reading monitor settings from .probe.byclass.monitor.
- Reading Server-Name from .probe.byclass.display.
- Calling Xf86ConfigAgent with these arguments.

Xf86ConfigAgent
----------------
This agent writes the configuration file for the program isax which
has following format:

Filename: /tmp/rc_sa???????

After it has been created, the program isax is called with this file.

Command:  isax -f <filename>
