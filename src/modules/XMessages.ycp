All 3D drivers in Linux are in developmental phases and are
therefore, in part, still regarded as experimental. Nevertheless,
we have decided to include the drivers in our distribution because of the
high demand for 3D hardware acceleration in Linux.

Because of the somewhat experimental status of OpenGL drivers, we are
not able to offer any installation support for configuring 3D hardware 
acceleration or if any problems related to this should arise. 

Do you want to enable 3D for this card?\n

string WarningNVidia = _("
The driver used for this card is not an official 2D/3D/OpenGL driver from 
nVidia for licensing reasons. The 3D/OpenGL driver used if you enable 3D 
is not hardware-accelerated.
    
To use hardware accelerated 3D/OpenGL, update the packages 
NVIDIA_GLX and NVIDIA_kernel for SuSE Linux from the nVidia web server 
(http://www.nvidia.com). You can also do this comfortably via 
YOU (YaST2 Online Update).
 
If there are problems with the 2D/3D/OpenGL driver from nVidia, consult
the vendor, as we unfortunately do not have any influence over the
development of nVidia drivers.

Do you want to prepare 3D for this card?\n
