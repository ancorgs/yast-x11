These module are leftovers from the old X11 configuration using isax.
They are not used directly for the X11 configuration with embedded SaX2
but they are or may be used by some other YCP modules. Therefore they are
left in here.

Display.ycp		- information about the display adapter

XF*.ycp			- modules for providing the information maps used
			  by the xf86config agent which in turn is used to
			  alter the XF86Config file.

X11Version.ycp		- utility to detect the X11 version used.
